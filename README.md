# Introduction

In gymnastics, one of the most important attributes is the athlete's numerical score. Performance scores provide valuable insights into trends across different apparatus and competition levels. Our project creates an interactive user experience for analyzing gymnastics scores by country. Users can see these score distributions for themselves using scatter/box plots, pytorch demonstrations and gaining a deeper understanding of athlete performance across all the different events. Our project leverages data analytics, monte carlo simulations, and machine learning to optimize national olympic gymnastics teams. We aim to:
● Identify the top 5 gymnasts who would optimize a team score
● Explore difficulty vs execution tradeoffs to maximize score potential
● Predict top scoring routines using neural networks and statistical models

# Project overview

● Allows users to select a country and view gymnastics scores for that region
● Provides 3 visualizations: scatterplot (individual score trends), box plots (understanding
score predictions), and pytorch ( neural networks and 3D models)
● Utilizes plotly to produce dynamic and interactive visualizations
